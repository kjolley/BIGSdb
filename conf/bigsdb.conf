#BIGSdb site-specific configuration file
#Set the attributes in this file specific to your system

###GENERAL####

#Location of web accessible temporary directory.
tmp_dir=/var/www/tmp

#Location of web-inaccessible secure temporary directory.
#Beware if your system uses systemd PrivateTmp - this may cause problems if you
#use /var/tmp since apache won't see files created by scripts run as the bigsdb
#user. This will affect the use of manually refreshed BLAST database caches.
#In this case it is better to use a temporary directory outside of /tmp
#or /var/tmp. Alternatively, disable the use of PrivateTmp by apache.
secure_tmp_dir=/var/tmp

#Location of web accessible submission directory.
submission_dir=/var/submissions

#Submission digests. If enabled, you must run the submission_digest.pl script
#(found in scripts/maintenance) regularly, e.g. every hour via CRON.
#Only enabled if using site-wide user databases.

#Copy curator in to close submission E-mail.
#Curator prefs override this setting if site-wide user databases are used.

#Directory used to contain system lock files
lock_dir=/var/run/lock

#Relative CSS and Javascript directories
#If uncommented then BIGSdb will not check if a required CSS or JS file exists.
#This is useful when using Apache aliases to serve CSS and JS files from a 
#directory that is outside of the web root.

#Site user databases
#Set name of global user database - this is optional. If this is not used
#then each database will maintain its own set of user details. Usually
#only one database will be specified here, but multiple databases are
#supported (enter a comma-separated list of user databases - each consisting
#of a display name, followed by a pipe character (|) and the name of the
