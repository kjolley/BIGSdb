#This script should be run frequently (perhaps every minute) as
#a CRON job.  If the load average of the server is too high (as
#defined in bigsdb.conf) or there is no job to process, the script
#will exit immediately.  Note that CRON does not like '.' in executable
#filenames, so either rename the script to 'bigsjobs' or create
#a symlink and call that from CRON.
